# 🧭 Product Vision – User Feedback Tracker

## 📌 Project Name:
**User Feedback Tracker**

---

## 🎯 Vision Statement:
To empower product teams to collect, organize, and act on user feedback with clarity and structure — enabling faster improvements, greater user satisfaction, and better alignment with real customer needs.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Target Users:
- End users of a product or service who want their voices heard
- Product Managers who need feedback to guide roadmap decisions
- Customer Support/Success teams looking to centralize feedback collection
- Internal teams who want visibility into user sentiment and feature requests

---

## 💡 Problem We’re Solving:
Product teams often receive scattered feedback across emails, calls, chats, and support tickets. This leads to:
- Missed opportunities for improvement
- No clear prioritization of requests
- Lack of transparency for users about what’s being built

---

## ✅ Our Solution:
A centralized platform where:
- Users can submit feedback easily
- Other users can upvote or comment on suggestions
- Admins can view, categorize, and mark feedback as "Under Review", "Planned", "In Progress", or "Released"
- Everyone stays informed with a transparent feedback loop

---

## 🌟 Key Benefits:
- Structured & centralized feedback process
- Encourages user engagement & product loyalty
- Empowers product teams with real-time insights
- Simplifies communication between teams and users

---

## 🛠️ MVP Scope:
- Submit feedback (title + description)
- View feedback list (sorted by upvotes or status)
- Upvote feedback (one vote per user)
- Admin panel to update status of feedback
- Basic authentication (optional for MVP)

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Vision:
- Email notifications for status updates
- Tags & categories
- Analytics dashboard for trends
- Integrations with Slack, Jira, or CRM tools
- Mobile responsiveness and dark mode

---

## 🗓️ Project Timeline:
- Week 1: Research, user stories, wireframes
- Week 2: Backend + frontend integration
- Week 3: Admin features + polish
- Week 4: Testing, documentation, and deployment

> “The best products are built with users, not just for them.”  
Let’s build a feedback system that closes the loop.
