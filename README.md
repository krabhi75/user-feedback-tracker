# 📝 User Feedback Tracker

A beginner-friendly product built to help teams **collect, manage, and prioritize user feedback** in one place.

This project is part of a **build-in-public initiative** to practice real-world product management skills — from ideation to execution.

## 🚀 Product Vision

> **"Build a lightweight tool that enables startups and product teams to capture feedback, organize feature requests, and track progress — without unnecessary complexity."**

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Small teams often receive valuable user feedback across multiple channels — emails, WhatsApp, meetings, spreadsheets.  
But without a centralized system, this feedback gets lost, under-prioritized, or miscommunicated.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Practice product thinking & documentation end-to-end
- ✅ Learn how to structure a product GitHub repository as a PM
- ✅ Apply PM skills in wireframing, scoping, persona building, and roadmap planning
- ✅ Share progress transparently as a product portfolio piece
